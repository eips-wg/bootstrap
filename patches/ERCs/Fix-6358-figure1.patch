 - The ERC-6358 smart contracts are referred to as **Abstract Nodes**. The states recorded by the Abstract Nodes that are deployed on different blockchains respectively could be considered as copies of the global state, and they are ultimately consistent.  
 - **Synchronizer** is an off-chain execution program responsible for carrying published  `o-transactions` from the ERC-6358 smart contracts on one blockchain to the others. The synchronizers work trustless as they just deliver `o-transactions` with others' signatures, and details could be found in the [workflow](#workflow).
