 # Ethereum Request for Comments (ERCs)
 
-*Please note that ERCs were recently separated from the [EIPs](https://github.com/ethereum/eips) repo.*
+The ERC project standardizes and provides high-quality documentation for
+the Ethereum application layer. This repository tracks past and ongoing
+improvements to the Ethereum application ecosystem in the form of Ethereum
+Request for Comments (ERCs). [EIP-1] governs how ERCs are published.
+
+## Contributing
+
+> [!WARNING]
+> Before you write an ERC, ideas MUST be thoroughly discussed on
+> [Ethereum Magicians][ethmag] or [Ethereum Research][ethres]. Once consensus
+> is reached, thoroughly read and review [EIP-1], which describes the EIP
+> process.
+
+To create a new proposal, **copy** the [Proposal Template][template] into the
+[`contents`] directory and rename it to `99999.md` (or `99999/index.md` if you
+have additional assets). The template has more detailed instructions.
 
-The goal of ERCs is to standardize and provide high-quality documentation for the Ethereum application layer. This repository tracks past and ongoing improvements application standards in the form of ERCs. [EIP-1](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1) governs how EIPs and ERCs are published.
+This repository is for documenting standards and not for help implementing
+them. These types of inquiries should be directed to the
+[Ethereum Stack Exchange][ethex]. For specific questions and concerns regarding
+EIPs, it's best to comment on the relevant discussion thread of the EIP denoted
+by the `discussions-to` tag in the EIP's preamble.
 
-The [status page](https://eips.ethereum.org/) tracks and lists both EIPs and ERCs, which can be divided into the following categories:
+If you would like to become an EIP Editor, please read [EIP-5069].
 
-- [Core EIPs](https://eips.ethereum.org/core) are improvements to the Ethereum consensus protocol.
-- [Networking EIPs](https://eips.ethereum.org/networking) specify the peer-to-peer networking layer of Ethereum.
-- [Interface EIPs](https://eips.ethereum.org/interface) standardize interfaces to Ethereum, which determine how users and applications interact with the blockchain.
-- [ERCs](https://eips.ethereum.org/erc) specify application layer standards, which determine how applications running on Ethereum can interact with each other.
-- [Meta EIPs](https://eips.ethereum.org/meta) are miscellaneous improvements that nonetheless require some sort of consensus.
-- [Informational EIPs](https://eips.ethereum.org/informational) are non-standard improvements that do not require any form of consensus.
+### Validation and Auto-merging
 
-**Before you write an ERC, ideas MUST be thoroughly discussed on [Ethereum Magicians](https://ethereum-magicians.org/) or [Ethereum Research](https://ethresear.ch/t/read-this-before-posting/8). Once consensus is reached, thoroughly read and review [EIP-1](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1), which describes the EIP/ERC process.**
+All pull requests in this repository must pass checks before they can be
