 ### Extended Usage: `requiredAssets` Parameter
 
-When a wallet indicates support for the `auxiliaryFunds` capability (i.e., `supported: true`), applications that use the [`wallet_sendCalls`](./05792.md#wallet_sendcalls) method MAY include a `requiredAssets` parameter in the `capabilities.auxiliaryFunds` object to enable the wallet to leverage this capability.

 A wallet's signaling support for the `auxiliaryFunds` capability does not necessarily mean they can interpret or use the `requiredAssets` metadata. The `requiredAssets` parameter is an optional capability that wallets may or may not support, even when they support the base `auxiliaryFunds` capability.

 ## Abstract
 
-This ERC introduces a new wallet connection JSON-RPC method focused on extensibility, `wallet_connect`. It leverages the modular capabilities approach defined in [ERC-5792](./05792.md#wallet_getcapabilities) to streamline connections and authentication into a single interaction.
