 We expect the community to align on the definition of additional capabilities in separate ERCs over time.

 Provider abstractions MAY also cache capabilities from previous requests or otherwise inject them from out-of-band to facilitate better user experience.
 If any of these supplemental expressions of capabilities are contradicted by capabilities expressed in live wallet RPC responses, these latter values SHOULD be taken as the canonical and current expression of capabilities.
