-To harmonize costs, we first set the gas cost of a single state byte, `cost_per_state_byte`. **This cost targets an average growth of 60 GiB per year at a block gas limit of 300M gas units and an average gas utilization for state growth of 30%**. A [recent empirical analysis](../assets/eip-8011/multidim_empirical_analysis.md) has shown that, at current gas prices, state creation accounts for approximately 30% of all gas consumed. ** Additionally, on average, blocks use half of the entire available gas in the block. Thus, we are setting the unit gas cost of state creation based on the average case. Finally, we are targeting a 300M block limit to account for scaling optimizations expected in the short to medium term.

 This capacity corresponds to an average of $\frac{60 \times 1024^3}{365} = 176,505,505$ bytes per day. With a 300M gas limit, Ethereum will process $150M \times 7,200 = 1,080,000M$ gas units per day, at block target. With a 30% consumption dedicated to state creation, the total gas units per day for state creation are $1,080,000M \times 0.3 = 324,000M$. Thus, the cost per byte is $\frac{324,000M}{176,505,505}=~1,835$. To provide a further buffer and simplify calculations, we round this number and set `cost_per_state_byte` to 1900.
