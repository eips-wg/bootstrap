 Note that some behaviours in the EVM depend on the transaction context. These behaviours include:
 
-1. Costs of the `SSTORE (0x55)` opcode per [EIP-2200](../../EIPS/eip-2200)
-2. Costs of accessing cold addresses and slots per [EIP-2929](../../EIPS/eip-2929)
-3. Values available within the transient storage per [EIP-1153](../../EIPS/eip-1153)
-4. Maximum amount of gas refund assigned after the execution per [EIP-3529](../../EIPS/eip-3529)

 These features are not affected by the separation of the transaction into multiple frames.
 Meaning, for example, that a value set with `TSTORE (0x5D)` in one frame will remain available in the next one.
